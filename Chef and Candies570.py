# There are N children and Chef wants to give them 1 candy each. Chef already has X candies with him. To buy the rest, he visits a candy shop. In the shop, packets containing exactly 
# 4 candies are available.

# Determine the minimum number of candy packets Chef must buy so that he is able to give 1 candy to each of the N children.

# Input Format
# The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
# The first and only line of each test case contains two integers N and X â€” the number of children and the number of candies Chef already has.
